I am a passionate and motivated individual with a deep interest in programming languages and data structures. 
Currently, I am advancing my skills in C and C++, and Iâ€™m also actively learning HTML, CSS, and different data structures. 
My enthusiasm for coding extends to participating in competitions, where I am at a beginner level but eager to grow.
